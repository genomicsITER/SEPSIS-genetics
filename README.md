# Genetic studies of sepsis
Sepsis is a life-threatening clinical syndrome of physiological, pathological, and biochemical abnormalities caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. Sepsis is accompanied by multiple organ dysfunction and is the leading cause of mortality in adults in Intensive Care Units (ICU). There is a lack of targeted therapies or effective methods for predicting prognosis or risk of death among these patients.

Since sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous disease, there is a lack of susceptibility GWAS in the literature to date. However, candidate genes studies and GWAS of sepsis mortality have associated common variants near genes involved in host defence, and movement of proteins within cells.

# GWAS of 28-day sepsis survival (2022)
We performed a meta-analysis of two steps with patients from the GEN-SEP network recruited at two different times. This stage analyzed a total of 687 European sepsis patients (506 survivors and 181 deceased) and 7.5 million imputed variants.

**Sample sizes for genome-wide analyses**

## Access to the results of this study
To help advance sepsis research and allow the wider research community to access to the most accurate effect sizes for genetic variants on a genome-wide scale, the variant summary data from the stage1 of the study by Hernandez-Beeftink T et al., 2022 (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.06.22274756v1) (476 MB) can be accessed after an internal assessment of formal requests received.

## What type of results would be made available?
No individual level data will be made available. Granted requests will have access to a file with the GWAS meta-analysis variant summary data with information for the following descriptors:

   •	**CHR**
   
   •	**POS**
      [According to GRCh37/hg19 reference]
   
   •	**SNP**
   
   •	**A1_REF**
      [Reference allele]
      
   •	**A2_ALT**
      [Effect allele]
   
   •  **PVALUE**
      [This is the p value from the meta-analysis]
   •  **COEF**
      [This is the beta from the meta-analysis]
      
   •  **SECOEF**
      [This is the standard error from the meta-analysis]
       
   •  **Model**
      [Based on the significance of Cochran's Q, the meta-analysis shows the result of the fixed effects model (FE) or the random effects model (RE2, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.04.014)]       
   •  **MAF**
      [Minor allele frequency taken from step 1]

## Who should I contact for requesting access to the data?
Requesters should contact **`cflores@ull.edu.es`** for requesting access to the data. Designated delegates of this collaborative effort will review the requests. Within a few days, an email with the instructions for data downloading will be obtained in response.

## Which information should I submit to access the variant summary data?
Requesters should provide a signed document including the following information: full name and title of the PI, affiliation, and a brief description of the project and the aims where the data is to be used. 

The document should explicitly state that the data requester also agrees to: use the data only as part of that indicated research, not redistribute the data outside the project without permission, acknowledge the provenance of the data in any dissemination of results.

A template document for the request is [here](https://github.com/genomicsITER/Sepsisgenetics/blob/master/Request_template.txt).
