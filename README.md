# Genetic studies of sepsis
Sepsis is a life-threatening clinical syndrome of physiological, pathological, and biochemical abnormalities caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. Sepsis is accompanied by multiple organ dysfunction and is the leading cause of mortality in adults in Intensive Care Units (ICU). There is a lack of targeted therapies or effective methods for predicting prognosis or risk of death among these patients.

Since sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous disease, there is a lack of susceptibility GWAS in the literature to date. However, candidate genes studies and GWAS of sepsis mortality have associated common variants near genes involved in host defence, among others.

# GWAS of 28-day sepsis survival (2022)
We conducted a two-staged GWAS (1; https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.06.22274756v1) involving GEN-SEP network patients (2) in the first stage and MESSI ICU patients (3) in the second stage. For the first stage, we performed a meta-analysis of the GEN-SEP network patients recruited at two different periods. The first stage analyzed a total of 687 European sepsis patients (506 survivors and 181 deceased) and nearly 7.5 million imputed variants. The second stage consisted on a follow-up of prioritized variants from the first stage on 2063 ICU sepsis patients.

## Access to the results of this study
To allow the wider research community to access the effect sizes and significance for genetic variants on a genome-wide scale, the variant summary data from the first stage of the study by Hernandez-Beeftink T et al. (1)(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.06.22274756v1) (filesize 476 MB) can be accessed after an internal assessment of formal requests are received.

## What type of results would be made available?
No individual level data will be made available. Granted requests will have access to a file with the GWAS meta-analysis variant summary data with information for the following descriptors:

<ul>
<li><b>CHR</b>.</li>
<li><b>POS</b>. According to GRCh37/hg19 reference</li>
<li><b>SNP</b>.</li>
<li><b>A1_REF</b>. Reference allele</li>
<li><b>A2_ALT</b>. Effect allele</li>
<li><b>PVALUE</b>. This is the p value from the meta-analysis</li>
<li><b>COEF</b>. This is the beta from the meta-analysis</li>
<li><b>SECOEF</b>. This is the standard error from the meta-analysis</li>
<li><b>Model</b>. Based on the significance of Cochran's Q, the meta-analysis shows the result of the fixed effects model (FE) or the random effects model (RE2)(4)</li>
<li><b>MAF</b>. Minor allele frequency taken from the first period of stage 1</li>
</ul>

## Who should I contact for requesting access to the data?
Requesters should contact **`cflores [at] ull [dot] edu [dot] es`** for requesting access to the data and review the request. An email with the instructions for data accessing will be obtained in response.

## Which information should I submit to access the variant summary data?
Requesters should provide, at least, a signed document including the following information: full name and title of the PI, affiliation, and a brief description of the project and the aims where the data is to be used. 

The document should explicitly state that the data requester also agrees to: use the data only as part of that indicated research, not redistribute the data outside the project without permission, acknowledge the provenance of the data in any dissemination of results.

A template document for the request is [here](https://github.com/genomicsITER/SEPSIS-genetics/blob/main/templates/Request_template.txt).
